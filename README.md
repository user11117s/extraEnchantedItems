This is a Spigot plugin (1.19.4) that adds enchanted ores (enchanted iron, enchanted gold, enchanted diamonds, etc.) and enchanted meat (enchanted steak, enchanted chicken, etc.)
All enchanted items are automatically smelt.

Chickens, cows, pigs and sheep have a small chance of dropping enchanted food. This gives you Saturation when eaten.
Iron ore, gold ore and diamond ore have a small chance of dropping enchanted iron, gold and diamond respectively.
You can craft enchanted armor/tools using these. The more enchanted ore instead of regular ore you use, the higher the level of enchantments. For example, using 2 enchanted and 6 regular diamonds to make a chestplate gives you a Protection I chestplate.
Using 8 enchanted diamonds gives you a Protection IV chestplate.
